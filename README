This directory contains the kconfig frontends and parser.

Kconfig is the configuration language used by the Linux kernel.
This package is a simple copy of the frontends and the parser found
in the Linux kernel source tree, with very minor changes to adapt
them to being built out of the kernel build infrastructure.

This package does *not* take any change to the parser or frontends.
Such changes shall be directed directly to the appropriate mailing
list, and they will eventually find their way is this package at
the next sync:
    mailto:linux-kbuild@vger.kernel.org
