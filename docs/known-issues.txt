This file lists the known issues encountered while packaging the kconfig
frontends.

----------------------------------------

Under Cygwin, the build does not succeed with both -Wall and -Werror.

----------------------------------------

Under Cygwin, the nconf frontends does not build, because headers are
hard-coded, and patching them would be too intrusive.

You have to explicitly disable nconf at ./configure time:
    ./configure --disable-nconf

----------------------------------------

Under Cygwin, gettext is not in the C library, but in an external libintl,
so it must be explicitly linked in. The packaging does check this situation,
and correctly link against libintl. libintl depends on some other libraries
(libncursesw and libiconv). Simply linking against libintl does pull the
dependencies in.

However, at least libiconv is not installed by default, even if the devel
libintl package is installed. This is considered a bug in the Cygwin
installation mechanism.

To fix it, re-run the Cygwin install process, and expressly select:
  - Devel/libiconv

(and say 'yes' if you are prompted for required packages), and re-build
(no need to re-run .configure).

----------------------------------------

Under Cygwin, gtk+2.0 depends on:
  - libglitz
  - libxcb-render-util
  - libpng12

but they are not installed by default, even if the gtk devel package is
installed.

To fix it, re-run the Cygwin install process, and expressly select:
  - X11/libglitz-devel 
  - X11/libxcb-render-util-devel
  - Libs/libpng12-devel

(and say 'yes' if you are prompted for required packages), and re-build
(no need to re-run ./configure).

gtk+2.0 is used by the gconf frontend.

----------------------------------------

Under Cygwin, Qt4 depends on libffi, but it is only available if you
installed the gcc4 package (the gcc package is a gcc-3).

To fix it, re-run the Cygwin install process, and expressly select:
  - Devel/gcc4

(and say 'yes' if you are prompted for required packages). You'll need
to re-run ./configure.

Qt4 is used by the qconf frontend.
